# Room-E

## Big Idea:
Part roommate-finder, part roommate-manager; Room-E's users are able to create their own profile, browse or list rooms for rent and advertise themselves as great roommates. Once users find a compatible cohabitor, they can utilize the built-in features like financial tools, task trackers, and group messaging to make living with roommates a breeze.

## Features:
* Roommate Finder: ability to browse available rooms, list yourself as a potential roommate, list available rooms for rent
* Money Tracker: splitting rent, utilities, household costs
* Task Tracker: delegating household chores, groceries or to-do lists
* Group Messaging: in-app communication
	
## Why We Stand Out:
Modern options for finding a roommate online are either weeding through weirdos and creeps on Craigslist, or taking your chances by paying for sites like RoomieMatch or Roommates.com. There are a lot of messaging apps, a lot of financial apps, and a lot of taskkeeper apps, but nothing that does it all. There is enormous benefit to having a home for all household-related issues, including transparency, ease of access, and streamlined communication.
